# UI-prototypes

This repository showcases my work in User Interface (UI) Design and Prototyping, created as part of my specialization in Interactive Systems within my Bachelor’s degree program. It includes style guides, design documentation, and prototypes developed in courses like Interactive Systems I & II and Development Methods for Interactive Systems.

The files demonstrate my approach to structuring design elements, establishing style consistency, and creating functional prototypes.

Contents:

	•	Style Guides: Documentation on design rules, color schemes, typography, and layout structure.
	•	Prototypes: Figma links and PDF files of interactive designs and mockups for various projects.

This collection highlights my skills in UI/UX principles and prototyping tools like Figma, and reflects my interest in Human-Computer Interaction.
